    title: "Trust",

      "Trust is the number one factor to success in a partnership. This holds equally true for the relationship between a builder and the homeowner.

That is why JSM employs three accounting managers who are dedicated to processing our pay applications and reconciling our budgets with the utmost accuracy.  All facets of construction financing, draw processing, taxes, insurance, and more are performed in-house and available to you at any time.  This aspect of our company’s accountability is the real litmus test of integrity in an industry that has long been shrouded in dishonesty.",

  {
    title: "Time Management",
    description:
      "We have spent years fine tuning JSM to run efficiently by eliminating middlemen, empowering our staff, committing to our partners, not over-committing to work, planning ahead, designing well, scheduling precisely, and clearly communicating expectations with all parties involved.  Whether you are trying to move your family here to get life in the mountains started or you are trying to get here so you can wind-down in your retirement years, time isn’t replaceable. There is no reason to spend three years building a house when it should be done in one or two years.  It simply requires planning, focus, and resources.",
